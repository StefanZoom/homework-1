        <!-- Section explaining the choice -->
        <p>Scrambled eggs are the first type of food I've learnt to make on my own.
            I still remember awful taste they had after I made them for my very first time by only experimenting.
            That is probably the reason I like them now so much.Other than that,they are part of almost every nation's cuisine.
            One more thing,simplicty is always the best :D</p>

            <li>Use pan to apply heat to the mass you have just made and wait a couple of seconds</li>
            <li>If you wish,add cheese while eggs are hot in order to get it melted and tasty</li>
