            <!-- Section explaining the choice -->
            <p>Scrambled eggs are the first type of food I've learnt to make on my own.
                I still remember awful taste they had after I made them for my very first time by only experimenting.
                That is probably the reason I like them now so much.Other than that,they are part of almost every nation's cuisine.
                One more thing,simplicty is always the best :D</p>
